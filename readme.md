# React Easy State Todo
I just wanted to try out [react-easy-state](https://github.com/solkimicreb/react-easy-state) to see how it compares to Redux. I also tried out [MobX here](https://github.com/mildrenben/mobx-todo).

If you want to run it simply `yarn install` and `yarn start`, it'll be on `localhost:8080`.

Overall I enjoyed react-easy-state. Having all of your actions and data as part of the store takes a moment to get used to, but it's fine after that, and you could easily split them out into their own files. Would use for a small application.
